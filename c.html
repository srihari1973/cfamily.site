<h4> About C Language </h4>
<p style="font-size:20px">
C is an ideal programming language and a perfect combination of power and flexibility. Though it is a high-level language, it has low level features as well like easy interaction with hardware and OS. Even assembly language can be incorporated in it. It is accepted as a good system programming language. Powerful OS like UNIX was developed using  C.<br>
“C” is widely used in the software industry for both system and application side development. C is the primary subject in computer science; it lays good foundation in programming and eases the learning of any advanced courses that are to follow. So, it has been added in every branch of arts, science and engg as a part of curriculum. Every graduate student is going to face C,C++,Java, DS in the first year; by learning these in advance (in summer vacation itself), one can certainly make a good beginning in graduation.
