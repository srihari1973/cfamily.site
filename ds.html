<h4> About Data Structures </h4>
<p style="font-size:20px">
Data Structures is the study of data, various structures and related efficient algorithms to organize data. In addition, it gives idea about space & time complexity of data and algorithm. Most of the real time applications need DS to handle the simple, complex & huge data in an efficient way. The library functions help to organize the code efficiently, whereas data structures tools helps to organize data efficiently. DS tools help to a great deal, while handling data in primary & secondary devices. Today data structures are providing a readymade tools for modern software industry. One can not implement application without knowing data structures; Hence , its study is most desired for a computer professional.
