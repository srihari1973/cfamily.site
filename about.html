<h2>About C-Family</h2>
<br>
<p style="font-size:20px"   >

 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Software industry always needs highly talented professionals. As you are well aware, many of the existing
 computer institutions are owned and run by business men. These commercial institutions claim more than their capabilities
 and students trained from such institutions are being rejected by software industry.<br><br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    C-Family was not set up by any business group instead it was set up and successfully run by a group of eminent 
programmers. We provide hands on training to ambitious students in right proportions to their passion for knowledge. 
Needless to say, taking individual care of each student is the hallmark of our Institution.<br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Our courses are designed in such a way  that students get best foundation in logic and programming skills.
